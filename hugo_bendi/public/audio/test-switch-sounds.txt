TEST AUDIO FILE: test-switch-sounds.mp3

This is a placeholder for the cockpit switch sounds audio file.
In a real implementation, this would be an actual MP3 file containing:

- Toggle switch clicks (0:00-0:30)
- Push button sounds (0:30-0:60)
- Rotary selector clicks (0:60-1:15)
- Multi-position switch operations (1:15-1:45)

Duration: 1:45
Sample Rate: 44.1kHz
Bit Depth: 24-bit
Channels: Stereo

Each sound would be recorded with high-quality microphones
positioned to capture the mechanical characteristics accurately.
