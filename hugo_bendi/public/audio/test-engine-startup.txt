TEST AUDIO FILE: test-engine-startup.mp3

This is a placeholder for the engine startup audio file.
In a real implementation, this would be an actual MP3 file containing:

- APU start sequence (0:00-0:15)
- Main engine ignition (0:15-0:45)
- Engine spool-up (0:45-1:30)
- Stabilization at idle (1:30-2:34)

Duration: 2:34
Sample Rate: 44.1kHz
Bit Depth: 24-bit
Channels: Stereo

File size would be approximately 8-12MB depending on compression.
