This is a placeholder for the warning system audio file.

- Master caution chime (0:00-0:05)
- Fire alarm sequence (0:05-0:20)
- Low fuel warning (0:20-0:35)
- Hydraulic pressure alert (0:35-0:50)
- System failure tones (0:50-0:58)

Warning sounds are critical for pilot awareness and must be
distinctive, attention-grabbing, and immediately recognizable.
