## <Rs01> LittleCommander - AI Sound Production

### Project Overview

This project showcases the full integration of AI-generated sound in professional film production. Every audible element in the film——dialogue, Foley, sound effects, ambience, and music——was created entirely by artificial intelligence. The final work was mixed and verified in a Dolby Premier certified re-recording stage, presented as a 5.1-channel surround sound production.

### Production Period
**April 2024 - October 2024**

### Technical Achievements

Between April and May 2024, we conducted systematic tests on all the open-source and commercial tools for speech and sound synthesis available to us at the time. After extensive trials, only a small subset that met our production requirements was integrated into the film’s sound design. The final models actually used in the production are as follows:
- **Dialogue**: 
  - TTS/VC：Replica, Altered, Respeecher, ChatTTS
  - Bandwdth Extension: Resemble Enhance
- **Sound Effects(EFX, SFX, Foley, Ambience)**: 
  - Elevenlabs, Stable Audio, Pika, Krotos, MyEdit, AudioLDM, AudioGen
- **Music**: 
  - Suno, Udio, SoundRaw, AIVA
- **Edit and Mix**: 
  - ProTools


### Research Publication

We have documented our findings on AI speech synthesis technology applications in film dialogue production in a journal paper. The research paper has been published in *Modern Film Technology*. 
You can visit [Application Effects and Optimization Strategies of AI Speech Synthesis Technology in Film Dialogue Production](/static/publications/2025_AI_Speech_Synthesis.pdf) section to download the PDF file and read the complete research findings.

### Key Insights

This project is an important milestone in AI assisted film sound production. Although professional creators are still needed to take the lead in further areas such as timbre carving, spatial design, emotional shaping, and artistic creation, this study has demonstrated that artificial intelligence can support complete movie level audio creation by generating individual audio elements.

What lies ahead is not the end of artistic authorship, but a broader canvas—where AI augments the imagination of filmmakers and sound designers, and where new forms of sonic storytelling are waiting to be discovered.
