# My Journey in Sound Design

This is a test blog post to demonstrate the category filtering functionality.

## The Beginning

My journey in sound design began with a simple curiosity about how sounds shape our experiences in media.

## Learning and Growth

Over the years, I've learned that sound design is not just about creating sounds, but about creating experiences.

## Current Focus

Today, I focus on aviation sound design and creating immersive audio experiences for flight simulation.

## Future Plans

I'm excited to explore new technologies and continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in sound design.
