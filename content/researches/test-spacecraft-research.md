## Introduction

This is a test research report for the Researches section. The topic is spacecraft simulation and open source tools for aerospace engineering.

## Project Overview

We explore the use of open source software to simulate spacecraft attitude control and orbital mechanics.

### Key Features
- Real-time 3D visualization
- Physics-based simulation
- Modular codebase

## Example Code

Here is a simple Python example for simulating a spacecraft's attitude using quaternions:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation as R

# Initial attitude (quaternion)
q0 = R.from_euler('xyz', [0, 0, 0], degrees=True).as_quat()

# Simulate a rotation about the Z axis
delta_q = R.from_euler('z', 45, degrees=True).as_quat()

# New attitude
q1 = R.from_quat(q0) * R.from_quat(delta_q)
print("New attitude (quaternion):", q1.as_quat())
```

## Open Source Project

We use the [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org/) library for orbital mechanics and the [Spacecraft-Simulator](https://github.com/spacecraft-sim/spacecraft-simulator) project for real-time visualization.
